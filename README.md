# Enhanced Version of the ML-FOLD algorithm for Photonic Logic Gates

# üî¨ ML-FOLD Optimizer

**ML-FOLD Optimizer** is a Python module designed to analyze and optimize phase configurations for photonic logic gates (NOR/NAND) based on their predicted output characteristics. It computes a custom metric called `LogicOptScore` to classify configurations as *Optimal* or *Non-Optimal*, using a threshold defined as a fraction of the maximum score.

## üìå Features

* Supports **NOR** and **NAND** logic gate configurations.
* Automatically computes:

  * `Optimize_R`: Ratio-based metric to evaluate performance.
  * `ZeroStateUniformity`: Measures uniformity in ‚Äú0‚Äù state predictions.
  * `LogicOptScore`: Composite metric to identify optimal configurations.
* Filters out noisy data (NaNs, infinities).
* Classifies configurations into `Optimal` or `Non-Optimal`.
* Outputs summary statistics and classification breakdown.

## üß† Background

Photonic logic gates, based on phase-encoded inputs and nanophotonic structures, require carefully tuned configurations to operate with high fidelity. The **ML-FOLD** algorithm provides a way to evaluate such configurations using machine learning-predicted outputs, optimizing them without relying solely on physical simulations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - numpy

## Usage

1. **Ensure data files** are in the `data/` directory (`nor_data.csv` and `nand_data.csv`).
2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python src/ml_fold_optimizer.py
   ```

   The script processes both NOR and NAND datasets, calculates `optimize_R`, applies an 80% threshold of the maximum `optimize_R`, and classifies configurations as **Optimal** or **Non-Optimal**. Results include:
   - A DataFrame with phase angles, output powers, `optimize_R`, and classifications.
   - Maximum `optimize_R`, threshold, and class counts.


## Dataset Format

Each CSV file (`nor_data.csv`, `nand_data.csv`) contains:
- Columns: `phi_a`, `phi_b` (phase angles in degrees), `preds_AB_0`, `preds_A_1B_0`, `preds_A_0B_1`, `preds_AB_1` (normalized output powers for input states).
- Example row for NOR:
  ```
  45,45,0.6,0.6,0.62,0.6
  ```

## Methodology

1. **Load Data**: Reads phase configuration data from CSV files.
2. **Calculate optimize_R**:
   - For NOR: `optimize_R = preds_AB_0 / (preds_A_1B_0 * preds_A_0B_1 * preds_AB_1)`
   - For NAND: `optimize_R = (preds_AB_0 * preds_A_1B_0 * preds_A_0B_1) / preds_AB_1`
3. **Set Threshold**: 80% of the maximum `optimize_R` (configurable).
4. **Classify Configurations**: Labels configurations as **Optimal** (‚â• threshold) or **Non-Optimal** (< threshold).
5. **Output Results**: Displays DataFrame and statistics.

## Notes

- The threshold is a visualization aid and can be adjusted via the `threshold_fraction` parameter.
- The code includes error handling for missing files, invalid gate types, and malformed data.
- Future enhancements may include support for additional gate types or alternative threshold methods.
